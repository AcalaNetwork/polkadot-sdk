# Introduction

This document contains the specification of the JSON-RPC interface exposed by blockchain nodes in the Substrate ecosystem.

This specification aims at establishing a *lingua franca* between UIs, tools, etc. that would like to access a Substrate-based blockchain, and node client implementations that actually connect to the blockchain. Please note that it is, however, in no way mandatory for nodes to implement this specification in order to access a Substrate-based blockchain. As such, this specification is out of scope of, say, the Polkadot host specification.
