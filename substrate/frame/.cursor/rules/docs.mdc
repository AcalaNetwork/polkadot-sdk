- Follow the documentation guidelines in [DOCUMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md](../../../../../docs/contributor/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md)
- Always add Substrate copyright notice in the docs
- If items already have docs, don't expand it too much, just add more details if needed
- Don't document conventions in pallet development, like hash function selection, etc.
- Don't add sophisticated explanations for non-public items.
- Don't repeat comments that already exist in the trait definition, just focus on the implementation details
- Don't document why use some trait bounds if not specified explicitly in prompt.
