title: Add `export-chain-spec` substrate CLI command
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    1. Idea is introduce a function export-chain-spec that does the chain-spec exporting. build-spec will work as before, but have a deprecation message on usage.
    2. For now, this new command will focus on the ability to take the chain-specs embedded in the node and "exports" them to a json file
    3. We will not include the addition of boot node functionality, that the build-spec command has right now into the new command, if along the process, we decide otherwise, we can include it
    4. Part of this PR will also be to display the message the build-spec will soon be on deprecation path
