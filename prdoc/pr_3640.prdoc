title: Rename `RuntimeDbWeight` to `RuntimeDbRefTime`
doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      The `RuntimeDbWeight` struct was renamed `RuntimeDbRefTime` 
      to better reflect the fact that it can only be used to generate the `ref_time` component of the weight.
      `RuntimeDbWeight` is now a (deprecated) type alias for `RuntimeDbRefTime`.
