title: '`polkadot-parachain`: added asset-hub-westend-local paracahinInfo genesis patch'
doc:
- audience: [ Node Dev ] 
  description: |-
    - Provides some updated to the asset-hub-westend-local chain specification, by adding appropriate genesis patch for parachainInfo.
    - refactors the logic related to fetching `para_id` with the node, so that when failing to use `GetParachainInfo::parachain_id` we also get a log with the error (before defaulting to `para_id` extracted from chain spec).
