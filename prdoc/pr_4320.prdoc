    description: |
      Implementation of a whitelisting feature for signed solution submitters in the staking
      pallet. When a signed solution is validated and accepted, its account is whitelisted.
      A whitelisted submitter's based deposit is fixed and it does not depend on the size of the
      submission queue.
