    description: |
      Implementation of a whitelisting feature for signed solution submitters for staking.
      When a signed solution is validated and accepted, its account is whitelisted.
      A whitelisted submitter's based deposit is fixed and it does not depend on the size of the
      submission queue. In summary, this allows a dynamic set of previously successful signed
      solution submitters to submit a solution with a fixed fee.
