title: Switch to litep2p manual routing table mode

    description: |
      By default, litep2p will add to the routing table peers automatically.
      In this PR, peers are added to the routing table only if they implement the substrate protocols.
      For example, peers that implement the deprecated /kad/sup protocol will no longer be added to the routing table.
