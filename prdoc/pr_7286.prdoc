title: Remove feature flag checks for Elastic Scaling MVP

    description: |
      This PR removes conditional checks for FeatureIndex::ElasticScalingMVP,
      assuming elastic scaling is always enabled. This simplifies the backing
      and provisioner logic by making dynamic core allocation the default
      behavior.
