title: Currency to Fungible migration for pallet-staking

doc:
  - audience: Runtime User
    description: |
      Lazy migration of staking balance from `Currency::locks` to `Fungible::holds`. New extrinsic
      `staking::migrate_currency` removes the old lock along with other housekeeping. Additionally, any ledger mutation
      creates hold if it does not exist.
