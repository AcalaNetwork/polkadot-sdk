title: Add `para_ids` Runtime API

doc:
  - audience: "Node Dev"
    description: |
      Add a new runtime API for querying the registered paraids at a relay parent (both on-demand parachains and parachains holding bulk coretime). Using the Heads storage item from the paras pallet.

      This can be used for pruning the reputation database for the new collator protocol, so that we don't keep storing reputations indefinitely for parachains that have been offboarded.
