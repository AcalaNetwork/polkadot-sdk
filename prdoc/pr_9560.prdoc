title: 'proxy: migrate from Currency to fungible traits'
doc:
  - audience: Runtime User
    description: |
      - Migrate pallet-proxy from using Currency trait to using fungible traits, addressing the balance overlap issue where proxy reserves couldn't overlap with staking holds.
      - Implements multi-block migration with proxy preservation: migration failures preserve proxy relationships with zero deposits.
        - Pure proxy accounts can become permanently inaccessible when they lose their proxy configuration but retain funds in a keyless account. The existing Balances::force_transfer functions ensures no funds become permanently locked
        - For a regular account with proxies if the migration fails, the user retain control of their funds and can reconfigure proxies,
      - Fix benchmarks and update weights.
