title: Bridges - Add improved congestion control mechanism
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    This release introduces an enhanced bridge congestion mechanism, decoupling bridge queues from XCMP and improving suspension handling with bridge-specific channel control.
    Using `BridgeId`, `pallet-xcm-bridge-hub` and `pallet-xcm-bridge-hub-router` now support selective suspension and resumption of individual bridges.
    A new congestion detection feature in `pallet-xcm-bridge-hub` triggers `fn suspend_bridge` and `fn resume_bridge` callbacks:
    if the router is on a sibling chain, it sends `xcm::Transact(update_bridge_status(bridge_id, is_congested))` using stored callback data, while on local chains, it directly manages state.
    Additionally, a new `stop_threshold` in `pallet-xcm-bridge-hub` enables or disables `ExportXcm::validate`, acting as a safeguard if the router ignores the `suspend` signal.
    Finally, `pallet-xcm-bridge-hub-router` now flexibly supports message routing to either sibling chains (`ExportMessage`) or local deployments (`ExportXcm`),
    enhancing modularity and compatibility across deployment setups.
