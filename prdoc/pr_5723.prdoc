title: Adds `BlockNumberProvider` in multisig, proxy and nft pallets

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      This would allow these pallets to use the relay chain block number when deployed on a parachain. 
      However, we would need migrations if the deployed pallets are upgraded on an existing parachain.
