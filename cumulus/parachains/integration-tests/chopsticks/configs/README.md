This folder serves as a crucial reference for chopstick tests and the Parity-owned ecosystems,  
providing a working set of configuration files specifically for the Westend ecosystem.  
For additional resources and original Acala configurations, including documentation, refer to the [Acala repository](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/tree/master/configs)

Config files, especially `wasm-override:` fields there, assume that there is a `wasm` folder within the same parent directory, and it contains pre-built WASM BLOBs of the 
ecosystem under tests.
