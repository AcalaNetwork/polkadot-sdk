# step 0: start relayer
# (it is started by sibling 0003-required-headers-synced-while-active-westend-to-rococo.zndsl)

# step 1: initialize Westend AH
asset-hub-westend-collator1: run ../scripts/invoke-script.sh with "init-asset-hub-westend-local" within 600 seconds

# step 2: initialize Westend bridge hub
bridge-hub-westend-collator1: run ../scripts/invoke-script.sh with "init-bridge-hub-westend-local" within 600 seconds

# step 3: ensure that the HRMP channel between AH and BH is opened
asset-hub-westend-collator1: js-script ../helpers/wait-hrmp-channel-opened.js with "1002" within 600 seconds

# step 4: send message from Westend to Rococo
asset-hub-westend-collator1: run ../scripts/invoke-script.sh with "reserve-transfer-assets-from-asset-hub-westend-local" within 120 seconds

# step 5: ensure that relayer won't sync any extra headers while delivering messages and confirmations
bridge-hub-westend-collator1: js-script ../helpers/only-required-headers-synced-when-active.js with "300,rococo-at-westend" return is 1 within 600 seconds

# wait until other network test has completed OR exit with an error too
asset-hub-westend-collator1: run ../scripts/sync-exit.sh within 600 seconds
